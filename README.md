# Caesar Cypher

The Caesar Cypher is one of the simplest cryptographic techniques, named as such because it was used by Julius Caesar in his secret correspondences.
In the code, each letter of a sentence is replaced with the letter that is X number of places before it in the alphabet.

Caesar Cypher is written in ruby and rendered for the web with Sinatra.
